<p>2016 will be the seventh year in which I review the most important trends in the ed-tech industry. (You can look at the trends from other years <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>If you're interested in the data that drives this year's trends, explore the <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/2016trends">Github repo</a>. You can also read some of the <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/blog">updates on this project I'll pen throughout the year</a>.</p>
