<p>Way back in 2012, I selected &#8220;<a href="http://2012trends.hackeducation.com/platforms.html">The Platforming of Education</a>&#8221; as one of my &#8220;<a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>.&#8221; Re-reading that article now makes me giggle/cringe. (To be fair, re-reading any of my old articles makes me giggle/cringe.) I wrote then about the importance of APIs; the issues surrounding data security and privacy; the problem of silos; and the big education and big tech companies who were well-positioned (and/or hopeful) to become education platforms.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll revisit this topic in this year&#8217;s &#8220;Top Ed-Tech Trends,&#8221; but it is worth considering what&#8217;s happened to the LMS in this view. I know that Phil Hill and Michael Feldstein have <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/">predicted</a> that 2016 would be a big year for the LMS. (I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ve seen anything &#8220;big&#8221; yet, but it&#8217;s only April 30.) </p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious to see what happens to Edmodo, one of the early darlings of ed-tech investors. Certainly it had aspirations to become a major platform. It&#8217;s raised a ton of money &#8211; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edmodo#/entity">$87.5 million</a> &#8211; but I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s ever figured out a business model. And I&#8217;m not sure that technologically, it&#8217;s ever become a big <em>platform</em>.</p>

<p>I also thought at one point that this would be the path that some of the MOOC startups would take. &#8220;The arc of the ed-tech universe is long, but it bends towards the LMS,&#8221; as MLK did not say. But Udacity has pivoted to corporate tech training. And Coursera and edX feel like also-rans more than platforms. </p>

<p>The big platform in education? Google, probably. The other big players in education &#8211; the Pearsons etc &#8211; why aren&#8217;t they more platform-like? Do platforms even matter?</p>
