<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of trumpeting among Silicon Valley types lately that bots are poised to be the &#8220;hot new thing.&#8221; Bots are, of course, a very old thing &#8211; at least in terms of &#8220;the digital age&#8221; &#8211; traceable to the earliest theorization of computer science. (See: Alan Turing, &#8220;<a href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>&#8221; (1950), for example.)</p>

<p>Back in 2012, I chose &#8220;<a href="http://2012trends.hackeducation.com/ai.html">Automation and Artificial Intelligence</a>&#8221; as one of the &#8220;<a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>&#8221; of the year. Perhaps I was four years early in doing so. Perhaps not.</p>

<p>Some of the arguments that you hear today about &#8220;the rise of bots&#8221; are that artificial intelligence &#8211; particularly natural language processing &#8211; has reached a point where &#8220;personal assistant&#8221; technologies like Siri and Alexa are viable (commercially viable). Maybe. </p>

<p>The sudden interest in bots by investors and entrepreneurs certainly overlooks the fact that <a href="https://www.incapsula.com/blog/bot-traffic-report-2015.html">roughly half</a> the traffic on the Internet is already bots. We&#8217;ve already had to come up with &#8220;solutions&#8221; to this &#8211; filtering spam, filtering comments, blocking scripts, and so on. This new promise of bots seems to only see this technology as assistive rather than destructive. (Go figure.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in the implications for education, but I haven&#8217;t seen a lot of bot-talk in education (yet). <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/25/11492102/bill-gates-interview-education-software-artificial-intelligence">The Verge did recently ask Bill Gates</a> what he thought AI&#8217;s role would be in shaping the future of education. His answer was incredibly dull: something about &#8220;personalization.&#8221; He&#8217;s about as much of an expert on AI as he is on education, so there you have it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working on a history of chat-bots in education story because I do think what Gates et al call &#8220;personalization&#8221; is a lot like ITS (intelligent tutoring systems), many of which did feature &#8220;pedagogical agents,&#8221; like &#8220;personal agents&#8221; but for helpful hints on solving the next multiple choice problem.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see if this trend develops more. It&#8217;s one area in which venture capitalists are investing (in an otherwise dreary period for funding), so I do wonder if folks&#8217;ll pivot that direction just to follow the money.</p>
