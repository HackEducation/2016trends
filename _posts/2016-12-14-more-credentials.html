In an 11-page &#8216;Dear Colleague&#8217; letter released on Friday, the department lays out some changes in how it expects accreditors to do their jobs and how they will be considered for federal recognition, which is required for them to serve as gatekeepers for federal student aid. Colleges must be accredited by a federally recognized accreditor in order for their students to be eligible for such aid.&#8221; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/08/02/leader-troubled-accrediting-agency-resigns">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;Anthony Bieda is resigning as the leader of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, said the large, national accrediting agency, which is facing an existential threat. Bieda took over in April after the abrupt departure of the group&#8217;s longtime president, Albert Gray. In addition to Bieda&#8217;s resignation, roughly a quarter of the agency&#8217;s staff has been laid off in recent days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four small private colleges &#8211; along with one community college &#8211; have been placed on probation by the regional accreditor for the southern United States,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/06/20/southern-accreditor-puts-five-colleges-probation">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>.

<p>Albert Gray, the CEO of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, has suddenly <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/19/head-embattled-profit-college-accrediting-agency-resigns">resigned</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/09/19/paine-college-sue-over-loss-accreditation">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;Paine College announced on Saturday that it would sue the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools after its college commission rejected Paine&#8217;s appeal of SACS&#8217; June decision to strip the college&#8217;s accreditation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Military and veteran students who attend colleges that are accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) should be able to continue receiving Post&#8211;9/11 GI Bill benefits to attend those institutions, at least for another 18 months,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/09/26/gi-bill-benefits-and-acics-colleges">says Inside Higher Ed</a>.
