<p>Failed Republican Party candidate Jeb Bush &#8211; arguably the one with the most (or loudest) <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2016/02/jeb_bush_drops_out_of_gop_pres.html">policy experience in education</a> &#8211; has since <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2016/05/jeb_bush_foundation_chairman_return.html">retaken the reins</a> of his education organization Foundation for Excellence in Education. He also taught this fall <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/27/jeb-bush-harvard/">at Harvard</a>.</p>

<p>Several of the Republican Party candidates, including Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump (as well as Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson) said they would, as President, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2016/01/12/donald_trump_bashes_education_department_following_in_the_footsteps_of_reagan.html">close the Department of Education</a>.</p>

<p>Among the policies proposed by Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton: a proposal for <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/02/clinton-free-plan-would-boost-public-college-enrollment-harm-private-colleges">free, in-state public college tuition</a> for those with incomes up to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/07/clinton-proposes-tuition-free-public-higher-education-families-incomes-125000">$125,000</a> &#8211; a move that brought her campaign in closer alignment to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/us/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-education.html">those policies proposed by her rival Sanders</a>. She also <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/hillary-clinton-pledges-3-month-moratorium-on-student-loan-payments/112657">proposed</a> a three month moratorium on federal student loan payments.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/blacks-charter-schools.html">The New York Times on</a> recent resolutions by the NAACP and by the Movement for Black Lives: &#8220;Condemnation of Charter Schools Exposes a Rift Over Black Students.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the venture philanthropy organization NewSchools Venture Fund held <a href="http://www.newschools.org/news/live-summit-2016-movements-next-america/">its annual meeting</a> this spring, equity and structural racism were central to the message, and the event included many educators and education reformers of color on its speaking roster and in its audience. The Fordham Institute&#8217;s Robert Pondiscio described the event&#8217;s diversity as &#8220;<a href="http://edexcellence.net/articles/the-lefts-drive-to-push-conservatives-out-of-education-reform">The Left&#8217;s drive to push conservatives out of education reform</a>.&#8221; Marilyn Anderson Rhames, who works at a charter school, replied with &#8220;<a href="http://educationpost.org/an-open-letter-to-white-conservative-education-reformers/">An Open Letter to White Conservative Education Reformers</a>.&#8221; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not agreeing with every aspect of the left&#8217;s social agenda doesn&#8217;t make you appear as racists or bigots, as your post fears. However, deciding to cut ties with fellow reform-minded leaders who might look and think differently than you certainly will. When people of color who have worked long and hard finally get invited to a seat at the table, you probably shouldn’t get up and leave.</p>
<br />
<p>You call me a &#8220;social justice warrior&#8221; as if it&#8217;s a bad thing, as if the gospel of Christ doesn&#8217;t compel one to advocate on behalf of the poor, the widowed, the fatherless and the oppressed.</p>
<br />
<p>And where will you go, anyway? Are you longing for the good old days when the NewSchools Summit was an exclusive education reform country club? Is that really how you want to lead your urban education reform venture?</p>
