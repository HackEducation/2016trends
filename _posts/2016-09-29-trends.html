<p>In about a month, I&#8217;ll start working on this year-end series. So I&#8217;m starting to think about which ten trends I&#8217;ll focus on. My list, which is built in part from the topics I covered last year, is currently longer than ten:</p>

<ol>
<li>Business of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>Politics of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>The Collapse of For-Profit Higher Ed (Or Not)</li>
<li>The Employability Narrative</li>
<li>Data and Privacy</li>
<li>Beyond the MOOC</li>
<li>Social Media and Free Speech</li>
<li>Credits and Credentialing</li>
<li>Free College and Student Loans</li>
<li>Mindsets and Social Emotional Learning</li>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Wishful Thinking and Futures</li>
<li>Automation and Algorithms</li>
<li>Social Justice and Discriminatory Design</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of these won&#8217;t make the cut. Some of these could be consolidated. And I&#8217;ll probably use &#8220;Wishful Thinking&#8221; as a theme to kick off the series &#8211; that is, an eleventh post in the series.</p>
