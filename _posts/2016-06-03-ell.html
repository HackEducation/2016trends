<p>Nearly one in four US children speaks a language other than English at home. But there&#8217;s a shortage of bilingual teachers. So investors see opportunity. I&#8217;ve noticed a <a href="http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/02/17/jobs-zuckerberg-omidyar-invest-6-4m-in-edtech-startup-ellevation/">handful of investments</a> in ed-tech startups offering ELL software this year (but more importantly, I&#8217;ve heard <a href="http://www.reachcap.com/blog/post/2016-edtech-outlook">investors say</a> that this is an area that they&#8217;re currently very keen on).</p>

<p>Language learning, and particularly English-language learning, isn&#8217;t just a matter of K&#8211;12 or US education. Other big names in the space: Pearson English, Open English. (Interestingly, there haven't been any language-learning investments this year, despite that being a very active space in the past. I think investors are really interested on what they perceive as this different group: that is, ELL students at the K-12 level.)</p>
