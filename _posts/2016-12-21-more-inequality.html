<p>&#8220;As Trumplethinskin lets down his hair for tech, shame on Silicon Valley for climbing the Tower in silence,&#8221; <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/12/12/13917982/trump-hair-tech-summit-shame-silicon-valley">Recode Kara Swisher writes</a>.</p>

<p>News broke over the weekend that billionaire investor Peter Thiel is making <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html">a million-plus dollar donation</a> to the Trump campaign. Thiel spoke at the Republican Convention, but this is his first financial commitment to the campaign, one that comes on the heels of news that Trump has been accused by ten (or more?) women of groping and sexual assault. I wrote &#8220;an explainer&#8221; of sorts on Thiel and his politics, and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/10/16/thiel-trump-education-technology">I listed the education companies that he&#8217;s invested in</a>. Mostly surveillance posing as &#8220;personalization&#8221; startups. To be honest, think Thiel and his ed-tech politics have more in common with the rest of Silicon Valley than those that feign outrage at his support of Trump. Y Combinator (<a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/10/19/thiel-y-combinator">I list its education investments here</a>) has refused to sever ties with Thiel. He&#8217;s a partner there. So has Facebook. He&#8217;s on the board of directors. Some organizations have cut ties with Y Combinator over this &#8211; <a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/10/17/project-include-cuts-off-y-com.html">Project Include, for starters</a>, which works to address Silicon Valley&#8217;s lack of diversity. &#8220;Horrified by Trump, Silicon Valley Leaders Debate Cutting Ties to Peter Thiel&#8221; <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/horrified-by-trump-silicon-valley-leaders-debate-cutting-ties-to-peter-thiel">by Sarah Jeong</a>.

<h3>Equity in Testing</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/act-plans-center-to-help-underserved-students-succeed-in-college-and-work-force/112335">Via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>: &#8220;These days, everyone&#8217;s talking about &#8216;equity,&#8217; and now a testing company has affixed the word to a new effort. The company behind the ACT on Wednesday announced plans for a Center for Equity in Learning, which will focus on helping underserved students succeed in college and the work force.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/12/02/college-boards-new-process-accommodations">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;The College Board on Thursday announced a new process for people with disabilities to request test accommodations. Under the new system, most students who have been approved for test accommodations in high school will receive accommodations as long as their high school can answer two questions in the affirmative: &#8216;Is the requested accommodation(s) in the studentâ€™s plan?&#8217; and &#8216;Has the student used the accommodation(s) for school testing?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h3>Equity and Online Education</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://hechingerreport.org/hit-pause-button-online-blended-learning/">Should we hit the pause button for online and blended learning?</a>&#8221; asks The Hechinger Report&#8217;s Nichole Dobo on the heals of an NEPC report released last week that finds students in blended learning and virtual learning schools perform poorly. Julia Freeland Fisher of the Clayton Christensen Institute disagrees with the NEPC research, of course, <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/taking-correct-temperature-blended-learning/">insisting</a> that the research that agrees with its politics and policies, is better and in fact shows that blended learning &#8220;yields promising results for students.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Equity and Vouchers and Charters</h3>
<br />
<p>A group of parents has <a href="http://m.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/success-charter-network-accused-disability-violations-article-1.2503503">filed a complaint</a> with the Department of Education, claiming that the New York City charter school chain Success Academy has violated the civil rights of students with disabilities. (Meanwhile, WNYC <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/suny-charter-institute-probes-success-academy-discipline-practices/">reports</a> that the SUNY Charter Institute will investigate the chain&#8217;s discipline practices.)</p>

<h3>Racism in Textbooks</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;Activists and educators on Monday called a Mexican-American studies textbook proposed for use across Texas biased and poorly researched and argued that its contents are especially offensive in a state where a majority of public school students are Hispanic,&#8221; <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEXICAN_AMERICAN_STUDIES_TEXAS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">the AP reports</a>. &#8220;&#8216;Industrialists were very driven, competitive men,&#8217; the textbook says, according to excerpts. &#8217;In contrast, Mexican laborers were not reared to put in a full day&#8217;s work so vigorously. There was a cultural attitude of &#8221;manana,&#8220; or &#8216;tomorrow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h3>Ed-Tech and Imperialism</h3>
<br />

Liberia outsources entire education system to a private American firm. Why all should pay attention.&#8221; The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, has <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201603280584.html">said</a> that &#8220;Such arrangements are a blatant violation of Liberia&#8217;s international obligations under the right to education, and have no justification under Liberia&#8217;s constitution.&#8221; The company in question is Bridge International Academies, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bridge-international-academies#/entity">received funding</a> from the Gates Foundation and Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s investment company the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (among others). Families must pay that tuition &#8211; this isn&#8217;t free public education &#8211; and the cost is wildly prohibitive for most. Moreover, outsourcing to scripted lesson delivery does not build the capacity &#8211; in terms of infrastructure or human resources &#8211; that a struggling African nation might need. Simply saying <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-29-critics-emerge-as-liberia-hands-over-elementary-education-to-bridge-international-academies">&#8220;Critics emerge&#8221;</a> in response is sure one helluva passive voice way to dismiss these issues.</p>
