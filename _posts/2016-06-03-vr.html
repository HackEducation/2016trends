<p>Virtual reality appears on <a href="http://horizon.hackeducation.com/">one of the earliest Horizon Reports</a> &#8211; back in 2007, when it was predicted to be 4 to 5 years out from being a widely adopted technology in higher ed. I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re any closer to widespread adoption, truth be told. But entrepreneurs and investors and their <a href="http://educationnext.org/virtual-reality-disruption-3d-technology-education/">hype men</a> are pretty excited about the latest hardware. (Major players include Google and Facebook, both of which have expressed interest in VR in education.)</p>

<p>Some of that hardware is actually a lot like the old stereoscope, which tricked the brain into perceiving three dimensionality in a two dimensional image. Mattel has even brought back <a href="http://toyland.gizmodo.com/the-virtual-reality-view-master-2-0-will-be-the-best-go-1758981678">the old View Master</a> to work with Google Cardboard.</p>

<p>Much of the content these low-end products simply provide a viewing experience for 360 degree video. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/360-video-isnt-virtual-reality/">Is that really &#8220;virtual reality&#8221;</a>? I guess if you can&#8217;t get a product &#8220;on the horizon&#8221; to be widely adopted, you can just move the goalposts.</p>
