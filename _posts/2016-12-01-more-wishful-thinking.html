<p><em>This article includes news items that didn&#8217;t quite make the cut for <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/wishful-thinking.html">part 1</a> of <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com">my annual review of the year in ed-tech</a></em></p>

<h3>Robots Coming For Your Jobs</h3>
<br />
<p>There&#8217;s been lots of hullaballoo about artificial intelligence over the last few weeks because of the defeat of Lee Sedol, champion Go player, by Google&#8217;s AI system AlphaGo. It&#8217;s probably worth noting that elements of AI &#8211; machine learning, natural language processing, expert systems &#8211; are already all around us. So <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/03/16/470011574/what-artificial-intelligence-could-mean-for-education">when NPR says</a> &#8220;What Artificial Intelligence Could Mean For Education,&#8221; we shouldn&#8217;t just look at Pearson&#8217;s future-casting. We can look at what we already are doing with algorithms and machines.</p>

<h3>In the Future There Will Only Be 10 Universities</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;The coming era of consolidation among colleges and universities,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/09/07/the-coming-era-of-consolidation-among-colleges-and-universities/">Jeff Selingo predicts</a> in a Washington Post op-ed.</p>

<h3>Science, Debunked</h3>
<br />
<p>This isn&#8217;t ed-tech but like many I&#8217;ve been keeping a close eye on Theranos, a much-hyped health startup that&#8217;s come under scrutiny for its questionable scientific claims. This week, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> that &#8220;Theranos Voids Two Years of Edison Blood-Test Results.&#8221; Good thing there&#8217;s no one in ed-tech making questionable scientific claims, right?</p>

<p>The Online Learning Consortium <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/olc-study-90-students-see-online-experience-as-good-as-face-to-face/420923/">finds</a> students prefer online learning (contrary to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/02/17/study-suggests-high-school-students-hold-negative-views-online-education">other surveys</a> that find they do not. Weird).</p>

<h3>The History of Ed-Tech</h3>
<br />
<p>Well this is exciting. Ed-tech entrepreneurs seem to have discovered some <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-04-21-solving-for-x-a-math-coach-for-every-student">research from the 1980s</a>! (Or at least, they&#8217;re citing Bloom&#8217;s &#8220;2 Sigma Problem.&#8221;)</p>

<h3>The Promise of Flashcards Will Never Die</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;Duolingo wants to reinvent flashcards with Tinycards,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/duolingo-wants-to-reinvent-flashcards-with-tinycards/">says Techcrunch</a>.</p>

<h3>Pokemon Go</h3>

<h3>The Promises of Pinterest</h3>
<br />
<p>Oh look. <a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2016/08/09/watch-out-pinterest-a-new-site-is-trying-to-offer-classroom-inspiration-as-school-comes-back-in-session/">Another &#8220;Pinterest for education.&#8221;</a></p>

<h3>The Magic of Language Learning</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;Could the Language Barrier Actually Fall Within the Next 10 Years?&#8221; <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/132148/language-barrier-actually-fall-within-next-10-years">asks The New Republic</a>. Well, I suppose technological imperialism could bring about the end to most languages other than English, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what &#8220;technology expert&#8221; Alec Ross is talking about when he makes his sweeping promises about technology and language learning.</p>

<p>Because ed-tech suffers from amnesia, folks are once again predicting that virtual reality is poised (again) to be &#8220;<a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/virtual-reality-the-next-big-thing-poised-to-transform-education/">the next big thing</a>.&#8221;</p>

Well, one thing&#8217;s for certain: between this and Peter Thiel on its board, Facebook is well-positioned for a Trump presidency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg revealed that he wants to ensure that education has a chance to flourish in VR. That led to him announcing a $10 million fund specifically for learning applications.</p>
<br />
<p>&#8220;Education is going to be a powerful example of the potential of VR,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Already today, 10 percent of the experiences in the Oculus Store are education.&#8221;</p>
<br />
<p>On top of the funding, Oculus will get a specific spot in its store just for education. This could transform how teaching works going forward, and Facebook will stand at the center of that change.</p>
