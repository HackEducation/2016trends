<p>I've wrapped up my series "<a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015</a>," so it's time to start working on 2016. I plan to keep this blog updated regularly throughout the year. I'll post thoughts as the year progresses on what I'm seeing as emerging trends. I'll also link to all the weekly news summaries and weekly newsletters, so that it's easier to compile the data when I start working on the year-end series next December.</p>
