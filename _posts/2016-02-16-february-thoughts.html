<p>It&#8217;s far too early to say much about what the year has in store for ed-tech. But I want to call out a couple of trends &#8211; many just a continuation from <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">last year</a> &#8211; that seem to be popping up in &#8220;the future of education&#8221; narratives:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>For-Profit Higher Education</strong> (the sale of the University of Phoenix)</li>
<li><strong>Student Loans</strong> (perhaps this will be eventually expanded to talk about financial aid as a whole, but right now I&#8217;m still seeing plenty of investor interest in the private student loan market)</li>
<li><strong>Credentials</strong> (just today, <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/New-Credential-Aims-to-Make/235306">The Chronicle of Higher Education wrote</a> about a new credential program that aims to make professors better teachers. Not sure how a credential program does that &#8211; I mean, why not improve graduate education? This strikes me as another example of &#8220;credential creep.&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>The Employability Narrative</strong> (In the past, I&#8217;ve talked about the reframing of education&#8217;s purpose towards meeting the demands of employers. That seems to be continuing with, for example, the President&#8217;s &#8220;Computer Science for All&#8221; proposal tightly linked to the need for &#8220;high skilled workers.&#8221;)</li>
