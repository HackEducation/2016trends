<h3>Data Obsession and Data Collection</h3>
<br />
<p>Should we caution <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/11/16/aclu-declares-opposition-student-unit-records">the government from collecting even more</a> &#8211; something the Department of Education has indicated it plans to do?</p>

<p>&#8220;CCSF can&#8217;t prove it taught 16,000 students, must pay $39 million,&#8221; <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/City-College-can-t-prove-it-taught-16K-10791949.php">The San Francisco Chronicle reports</a>. <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/price-faculty-not-using-lms-39-million-ccsf/">Mindwires Consulting&#8217;s Phil Hill says</a> this is the &#8220;price of faculty not using LMS.&#8221; Rather, it&#8217;s the price of deciding that &#8220;proof&#8221; of online education requires the LMS.</p>

<h3>Students as Cheaters</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/03/30/examity-shares-data-cheaters">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;About 6 percent of students who took an online final exam proctored by Examity last fall broke the rules. &#8230; Most of the attempts to cheat came in the form of a cheat sheet (21 percent) or using Google to look up answers or translations (14 percent).&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ohio State Accuses 85 Students of Cheating on Online Tests,&#8221; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/ohio-state-u-accuses-85-students-of-cheating-on-online-tests/112000">The Chronicle of Higher Education reports</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;New Services Make Cheating Easier Than Ever For Students,&#8221; <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jeremymassler/cheating-on-demand#.tb0Dgy0pR">Buzzfeed reports</a>.</p>

<p>Interesting verb choice in this <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/sophisticated-test-scams-from-china-invade-u-s-college-admissions/">headline</a>: &#8220;Sophisticated test scams from China invade U.S. college admissions.&#8221; And the subhead: &#8220;Students hire imposter &#8216;gunmen&#8217; to take the SAT, the GRE and other tests.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Breaches and Vulnerabilities</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/3057204/security/schools-put-on-high-alert-for-jboss-ransomware-exploit.html">Via CSO</a>: &#8220;Schools put on high alert for JBoss ransomware exploit.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Evernote updated its privacy policy, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/15/evernote-defends-access-to-your-notes-in-its-new-privacy-policy/">the new terms said</a> that the company&#8217;s employees would be able to read people&#8217;s notes in order to improve its &#8220;machine learning.&#8221; Needless to say, folks were upset, and despite insisting it wasn&#8217;t a big deal at first, the company has now changed its mind. You&#8217;ll have to opt-in to having your notes perused. </p>

<p>Speaking of cybercrime, you know it&#8217;s bad when <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602979/ransomware-took-san-franciscos-public-transit-for-a-ride/">hackers use ransomware</a> to attack San Francisco&#8217;s public transit system. Good thing all the technologists in the vicinity are out there solving the world&#8217;s most pressing problems.</p>

<p>UC Davis suffered a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/05/31/learning-management-system-outage-uc-davis">week-long LMS outage</a>, and lots of folks had to weigh in with their thoughts on what this meant about <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/uc-davis-may-lms-fix-update-know-scriba-sakai-outage/">Sakai</a>, <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/scriba-disaster-sakai-based-lms-uc-davis-no-plans-recovery/">running one&#8217;s own infrastructure</a>, and <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/uc-davis-sakai-and-open-source/">open source</a>. &#8220;The end is near,&#8221; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/dianalopezsolorzano/uc-davis-back-at-it-again-xrcr">as Buzzfeed put it</a>. Interestingly, the University of Calgary was hit with <a href="http://www.calgarysun.com/2016/05/30/malware-attack-disables-university-of-calgary-systems">a massive malware attack</a>, <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/it/event/2016-05-28/systems-issues-update">taking out email</a> &#8211; EMAIL! &#8211; for the week and no one had a &#8220;hot take&#8221; on what this means for the future of that particular piece of university tech. Weird.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/11/03/arrest-email-hacking-75-colleges">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;The FBI and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York on Wednesday announced the arrest of a Phoenix-based man who attempted to gain access to more than 2,000 university email accounts at more than 75 colleges and universities.&#8221;</p>

Trademarked standards.</p>

<h3>Privacy Legislation and Lawsuits</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2016/07/uo_settles_lawsuit_with_2_form.html">Via The Oregonian</a>: &#8220;Two former University of Oregon Counseling &amp; Testing Center employees, who blew the whistle on a superior they said accessed an alleged rape victim&#8217;s health records without her consent, settled a lawsuit with the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bill designed to strengthen the privacy and security of student educational data continued down its apparently smooth path to passage Wednesday, winning unanimous Senate Education Committee approval,&#8221; <a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/co/2016/04/27/data-privacy-bill-clears-senate-committee-with-tweaks/">Chalkbeat reports</a>. Lest you think this is a story about federal legislation and that DC gridlock is over, to be clear, this is a measure in the state of Colorado.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20152016/SB/281">Proposed legislation</a> before Georgia&#8217;s General Assembly would &#8220;require schools to provide certain information to students and parents prior to using any digital-learning platform; to provide for definitions; to provide for destruction of student data collected through a digital-learning platform; to provide the opportunity to opt out; to provide for legislative findings; to provide for related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Privacy Protections and Privacy Education</h3>
<br />
<p>Bill Fitzgerald looks at <a href="https://funnymonkey.com/2016/ferpa-directory-information-as-anchor-data">school directory information</a> and how much can be gleaned from this data, despite the privacy protections that FERPA purports to provide.</p>

<p>Common Sense Media has launched a &#8220;<a href="https://privacy.graphite.org/">Privacy Policy Browser</a>,&#8221; that as the name suggests looks at the policies of several popular ed-tech apps.

<h3>Education Technology, Data Collection, and Infosec</h3>
<br />
<p>Apple released a <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/preview/">preview</a> of features that will appear in iOS9.3 and that will help schools manage devices more easily. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-11-new-apple-ios-updates-improve-device-management-for-schools">More via Edsurge</a>.</p>

<p>Apple has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/01/29/profit-college-execs-sentenced-financial-aid-visa-fraud-charges">acquired</a> LearnSprout, a company that initially worked on API- and SIS-integration tools (but that had recently pivoted to an analytics dashboard). Edsurge surmises that the acquisition will help Apple with new iOS features that promise to better integrate devices and apps into school administrative tools.</p>

<h3>A Culture of Surveillance</h3>
<br />
<p>Inside Higher Ed <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/12/12/student-secretly-records-professors-anti-trump-comments">reports</a> that a student filmed a psychology instructor at Orange Coast College as she made comments in class about Donald Trump and posted the video to the College Republicans&#8217; Facebook page. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/12/14/professor-leaves-california-due-threats">She&#8217;s had to flee the state because of threats</a>. </p>

<p>And I guess that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a little skeptical about professors clamoring to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/12/10/505109280/professors-take-a-different-approach-in-responding-to-leftist-propaganda-claims">be on &#8220;the watchlist.&#8221;</a> A better tactic, <a href="http://fragments.audreywatters.com/2016/adding-your-name-to-a-list">I&#8217;d argue</a>, is to make sure your department and institution have concrete steps they&#8217;ll take in order to protect academic freedom and &#8211; quite literally &#8211; protect academics&#8217; lives when these sorts of threats occur.</p>
